Here's a world.

---image:img/ISCS2020.003.png

Attention is naturally drawn to the centre; easily recognized, more resources, more order, more elaborated, established, ...

---image:img/ISCS2020.004.png

If we all follow that tendency, if we all try to go to the centre...

---image:img/ISCS2020.005.png

...the world might seem to get smaller

---image:img/ISCS2020.006.png

But the world isn’t small.

---image:img/ISCS2020.007.png

If we look to the edges...

---image:img/ISCS2020.008.png

... the world reveals more, feels greater.

---image:img/ISCS2020.009.png

Here order meets the unknown and reveals intricate heterogeneity... 

---image:img/ISCS2020.010.png

...liminal zones that reveal passageways or seeds into new worlds.

> OECD: "Research comprises creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications."

As a member of the research community, you are building on the knowledge that others have acquired before you and providing a map for those who come after you. **Research is built on sharing**. You are adding to a body of work that will never be complete. 

Place yourself in the shoes of one that follows you. What qualities do you look for? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Interestingness? Innovativeness? Significance? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Relevance? Specificity? Depth? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Effectiveness? Trustworthiness? Usability? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- Asking a question that nobody has asked before, *and showing that it is worth answering*
- Doing the necessary work to respond to it, *and showing that it is done systematically/effectively/correctly*
- Communicating the knowledge you have acquired to a larger audience, *in a way that it can be built upon*

# how can we know what we don’t know?

## The research question / problem statement

**Grounded speculation**

Personal motivation. It should something you are genuinely interested in. What does your curiosity dwell on? Do you have an original idea or independent perspective to contribute? Something that is difficult yet that you care about enough to make real?

Scholarly grounding. Often the problem statement of research is not apparent from the start. A **literature review** can identify flaws or holes in previous research, and provide justification/relevance for the study. Often the literature review happens before the problem is identified. A gap in the current literature engenders a research question/hypothesis.

Through a feedback of speculation and grounding the idea can become more concrete, specific, and *narrow*.

## Research is speculative; points to the *future*...

The broader motivation is often highly speculative, and often deeply questions or contradicts the status quo. Ask:

- What does (the world / my culture / my discipline) need (right now / in the future)?
	- What are the "ten questions" in your field?
	- What has been predicted as the impending future -- and what does it need? Or, what is missing from these predictions?

---

- Or, what have we missed in the past? Or, what are we missing by seeing the future through a [rear-view mirror](http://lightthroughmcluhan.org/rearviewmirror.html)?

---

- Or, place your questions outside the field:
	- What is common to all works in a medium, and specific to a medium, yet only rarely articulated? Look for the elephant in the room. What can change our perception of the medium itself? Or, what can be taken away without losing the essence?
	- What is the mountain to climb (not hill)? Go to the edge - there’s not that much there - work back.

## ...yet research must also make concrete

Work toward a definition of the problem that is *clear & concrete*.

At early stages, diagrams, maps and keywords can be far more useful than prose.

*Use* the literature

- Identify clearly the state of the art you are advancing (the field or domain). What are the assumptions you are overthrowing?
	- Or, you may be inventing your own field. Don't try to legitimate a new field by making a case; show it by demonstration.

---

- The idea should be specific: research goes narrow & deep, not wide & shallow. Keep returning to the original question; the articulation is usually too general, and needs to be sharpened.
	- What will you do & why is it worth doing?
	- What is the state of the art & where does your work fit?
	- What is the form of the contribution? (Technical, artistic/compositional/performance, theoretic, ...)?
	- What are the key decisions & unique differentials?
	- What will you **not** do?

# Research should be worth it

---

- What can you identify that differentiates world-changing ideas from common ideas?
	- Architecture professor: "Take your brain and throw it into the future as far as you can. Take something said to be impossible and make it. The greater the impossibility, the greater the value of the contribution."

What will the field, or the world, look like in 5, 10, 20 years? What might be a [Black Swan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory) event that would radically change things? In what should you be conducting your research or research-creation?

SSHRC conducted a "horizon scan" to identify 16 [future global Challenges for prioritization](https://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/funding-financement/programs-programmes/challenge_areas-domaines_des_defis/index-eng.aspx) of emerging technology, whether as opportunities and new directions for societies as well as warnings of potential crises. They then asked researchers:

- Which areas would you prioritize? 
- For each area that should be prioritized:
	- What is a compelling example you have recently seen or heard related this area?
	- What are the most significant **changes** that the challenge would cause?
	- Over the next decade, what **impacts** would these **changes** have?
	- What could happen when two of these **impacts** interact? 
- Is there a challenge not listed that you think should be included?

# Research Communities

The specificies of research methods can vary widely according to the values of different disciplines and communities. For example,

- Basic/pure research: pure knowledge, unknown applications.
- Applied research: more progmatic, empirical.
- Research & development (R&D): services/products, typically commercially driven.

### Scientific research

- Application of scientific methodology.
- Providing information and theories to explain the nature and properties of the world.
- Often involves conducting experiments in the lab or in the field.
- Predictability, reproducibility, cohesion with existing models (but [paradigm shifts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions))

--- 

"In the world of scientific research today, there's a revolution going on—over the last decade or so, scientists across many disciplines have been seeking to improve the workings of science and its methods. To do this, scientists are largely following one of two paths: the movement for reproducibility and the movement for open science. Both movements aim to create centralized archives for data, computer code and other resources, but from there, the paths diverge. The **movement for reproducibility** calls on scientists to reproduce the results of past experiments to verify earlier results, while **open science** calls on scientists to share resources so that future research can build on what has been done, ask new questions and advance science."

[https://phys.org/news/2020-09-outlines-cultures-science.amp]()

### Research in the humanities

- Less searching for an ultimate correct answer, more exploring the issues and details surrounding
- Context (social, historical, political, cultural or ethnic) is critical.
- Archival work, surveys or in-depth interviews.

### Art as Research

> Pablo Picasso said: "I never made a painting as a work of art, it’s all research."

AKA artistic research, 'practice-based research', "research-creation" 

When creative works are both the outcome and the object of research. 

This entered academic institutions relatively recently, and is still somewhat controversial. If art is also research, how is it defined, and how is it evaluated? 

---image:img/art-eating-itself.gif

> "If artistic research eats itself, digests itself and then releases its own waste, does it stink and linger, fertilise new growth or invade new destinations on the bottom of someone’s shoe? If we are to constantly defend and define, are we in danger of having no art left, only the claims for its ability to embody knowledge? When we bite off our own heads do we grow new tails?"

["Artistic Research Will Eat Itself​":](http://sarconference2018.org) The 9th International Conference on Artistic Research

Why not ask those who fund art research? 

---

SSHRC describes ["research-creation"](http://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/funding-financement/programs-programmes/definitions-eng.aspx#a22) as: "an approach to research that combines creative and academic research practices, and supports the development of knowledge and innovation through artistic expression, scholarly investigation, and experimentation. The creation process is situated within the research activity and produces critically informed work in a variety of media (art forms). Research-creation cannot be limited to the interpretation or analysis of a creator’s work, conventional works of technological development, or work that focuses on the creation of curricula." 

notes:

The [Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC)](http://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/funding-financement/index-eng.aspx?tab=0&aID=6&pID=0), is one of Canada's three large research funding agencies, and primary source of arts-based research funding; i.e. who you may be applying to funding from.

[SSHRC Proposals](http://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/funding-financement/apply-demande/background-renseignements/preparing_research_creation_application_idg-preparer_l_application_recherche-creation_sds-eng.aspx) "should contain both a developed scholarly apparatus and an integral connection to contemporary literary/artistic practices. A research-creation approach represents sustained, reflective research set directly and actively within the creation process itself. Research exclusively about the creation process or about literary/artistic productions, or creative work involving minimal scholarly investigation, will not be considered. 

- Address clear research **question**
- Offer theoretical **contextualization** within relevant fields of inquiry 
- A well-considered **method**ological approach and creation process

Both the research and any resulting creative work must meet peer standards of excellence and be suitable for publication, public performance and/or viewing. The theory and methodology must be aligned with the proposal’s objectives, and the proposal should clearly demonstrate how the research informs the creation process, as well as how the creation process is integrated into and relevant to the project."

notes:

Those three parts roughly correspond to the first three chapters of a thesis: the statement of the research question/problem, the literature review, and the methodology.

# Research Evaluation

What qualifies as *good* research? One way of knowing this is to look at how research is *reviewed*. Again, most grant appplications, but also journals and conference review bodies often publish guidelines for reviewers. These are the criteria by which your work will be evaluated. 

- [Wikihow](https://www.wikihow.com/Review-a-Journal-Article) to review an article!
- Guidelines from [Springer](https://www.springer.com/authors/manuscript+guidelines?SGWID=0-40162-6-1261021-0#:~:text=Reviews%20should%20be%20conducted%20fairly,less%20useful%20to%20your%20field.), [Wiley](https://authorservices.wiley.com/Reviewers/journal-reviewers/how-to-perform-a-peer-review/step-by-step-guide-to-reviewing-a-manuscript.html), [Elsevier](https://www.elsevier.com/reviewers/how-to-review)

These are general guidelines, but practices and cultures of value can differ very greatly between different research communities -- and we are often transdiscplinary... 

notes:

- Is the manuscript written in an understandable way?
- Is all the relevant information available to you?
- Is there an aim, research question or reason for doing the research, and has this research been put in the context of previous work?
- Have all methods been described in sufficient detail to allow others to evaluate and/or replicate the work in similar circumstances?
- Have the results been presented and discussed clearly and completely?
- Do the results support the authors’ conclusions?
- Are the included additional files (supplementary materials) appropriate?
- Are there any ethical or competing interests issues you would like to raise?
- Do you have any other suggestions that might help the author(s) strengthen their paper to make it more applicable to the community?
