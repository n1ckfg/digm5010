## Wonder, wander, make

What is your research?

On the on hand; the culture, history, context of what we do. On the other, our personal trajectory, our development as researchers and creators.

A futorologist said: to understand the future, we must go much further into the past; to see patterns that recur and trajectories behind the present. However this doesn't mean entering the future through a rear-view mirror (McLuhan's warning); it is to understand the language and concepts we see the world in today, and see their gaps and limitations.

We are in a program of digital media, co-run by computational arts and computer science. Art & science. "Two cultures", meeting through a cybernetic medium of computation.

To discover something new, we cannot follow a single path. Collisions between trajectories derail and open into new possibilities (or sometimes re-open them). Deductive reasoning (logical causation from the general to the particular) can never make a creative association. Insights demand moving from the particular to the general, whether as predicting outcomes (induction) or proposing hypotheses (abduction).

Be comfortable to get out of your comfort zone. Learn from each other. It's OK to be awkward. Children are the most awkward, and the fastest learners, so let's be children.

## Introduction to Javascript

We'll start our technology explorations using Javascript (JS), and a simple online live editor called [Codepen](https://codepen.io). 

Learning resources:

- [Javascript language notes here](https://github.com/worldmaking/worldmaking.github.io/wiki/JS-notes)
- [Javascript Canvas & Vector API notes here](https://github.com/worldmaking/worldmaking.github.io/wiki/JS-Canvas,-Vector,-Matrix-etc.-notes)

[The starter code is here -- Fork this pen to make a new sketch](https://codepen.io/grrrwaaa/pen/qMzrjb)

## Tasks

- Make sure you have signed up for a free account on Codepen. 

	- Starting from what we did in class, create an **unusual** drawing app in Codepen to share next week.

- Read Chapters 1-3 [Braitenberg, Valentino. Vehicles: Experiments in synthetic psychology. MIT press, 1986.](Braitenberg_Vehicles_Ch1-6.pdf)

- Download at least two of the recent ISEA proceedings, and start collecting papers that you find most relevant to your own work. You might find them interesting or inspiring -- you might also observe their weaknesses or unrealized potential. Regardless, you will need to collect several papers in order to form an initial bibliography to frame your own work.
