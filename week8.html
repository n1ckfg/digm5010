## Nov 19

For your convencience, we can have these meetings in the Alice Lab, room 309 CFA (right above the Dean's office)

1:30 Zhouyang
2:00 Jacob
2:30 Andrew
3:00 Janica, Lorena & Raechel
 
The ISEA deadline has been extended (I thought it would!). According to http://isea2020.isea-international.org/submission-guidelines/ the submission deadline has been extended to a far more reasonable and typical December 9 – which means an extra two weeks (yay!) – but also puts it right in the exam week, so make sure you schedule your plans if you need to take that into account.
 
## Nov 26

For next week’s class, we will again have individual meetings. 
 
Monday 25 1:30pm Zhouyang
Monday 25 2pm Jacob
Monday 25 2:30pm Andrew
Tuesday 26 1pm-2pm Janica, Lorena & Raechel

For next week, please share with me a Google Doc or some equivalent online format document that we can co-edit, with a draft of the paper including at minimum, the abstract, an outline, and list of references, but as much as you can beyond that.
