# Foundations of Digital Media

**Synopsis:** The purpose of Foundations is to equip and assist students to undertake graduate-level research in Digital Media. This means, being aware of the broad range of the field along with its nearer and farther histories (and implicated futures); being able to find, read, and understand the languages through which research is articulated (in theoretical and practical terms); being able to create work across of a broad range of digital media that is effective and/or innovative.

**Class/lab time:** Tuesdays 1pm-4pm   
**Location:** ACW 103   
**Course director:** [Graham Wakefield](https://ampd.yorku.ca/profile/graham-wakefield/), grrrwaaa at yorku dot ca   
**Materials**: [Course notes](https://worldmaking.github.io/digm5010/)  

## Motivation

The Digital Media graduate program's academic objectives include promotion of an interdisciplinary approach to computational art-making and technology development, providing students with 21st century “real-world” skills in tandem with research acumen. To work and conduct research in this area means skillfully bridging literacies in art, science and engineering practices. The goals are:

- to learn the essential technical and methodological skills of graduate-level research in areas of digital media and computational arts
- to attain literacy in mathematical, theoretical, and computational bases as they intersect with world of digital art-making, 
- to develop deep understanding and a real feel for computation as a creative medium.
- to be able to adequately place one's research within a larger network of relations and lineages, and be able to articulate its relevance and identify its values in context.

## Methodology

Establishing these foundations is ultimately evaluated through the ability to understand and transfer published research in these fields into creative applications, recreating or mutating established research results, projects, or works to the specific interests of a student’s research area(s).

In the first part of the class, we will examine exemplary methods and projects in diverse practices of computational art, music, video games, information visualization, web-based media, responsive architecture, etc., including the examination of landmark texts and projects in the history of digital media, computational arts and culture, addressing the continual overlap between artistic and scientific practices. Every week you will be given readings and be expected to *make* in response, and to show what you have made. These and other activities in class will account for **60%** of the final grade. 

In the second section of the course each of you will focus on a specific research paper or project from the literature (chosen in consultation of the instructor). The goal here is to functionally reproduce and interestingly mutate work from the resaerch community and literature. It implies a more significant project than the weekly makings, but it could be a continuation of one of them.

- This project demonstrates your foundational literacy and ability to understand and transfer published research into creative applications. (**20%**)
- You will also document this project a research paper with scholarly citations on the topic area. (**20%**)

You may also choose to present this project at the end-of-semester graduate event.

The [grading scheme for graduate study at York](http://gradstudies.yorku.ca/current-students/regulations/courses-grading/) is as follows: 90+ A+ (exceptional), 85+ A (excellent), 80+ A- (high), 75+ B+ (highly satisfactory), 70+ B (satisfactory), 60+ C (conditional), <60 F (fail) or I (incomplete).

## Topic for Fall 2019: Sentience (ISEA 2020)

Next Spring, ISEA2020 will take place in Montreal. As one of the primary research venues for our field, we will use this chance encounter with it being so close to us to organize our activities in the course this year, with the aim of sharing our work in Montreal next Spring. 

**ISEA** is one of the most prominent international events on art and technology around the world, bringing together scholarly, artistic, and scientific domains in an interdisciplinary discussion and showcase of creative productions applying new technologies in electronic art, interactivity and digital media. 

> Founded in the Netherlands in 1990, ISEA International (formerly Inter-Society for the Electronic Arts) is an international non-profit organisation fostering interdisciplinary academic discourse and exchange among culturally diverse organisations and individuals working with art, science and technology. The main activity of ISEA International is the annual International Symposium on Electronic Art (ISEA). The symposia began in 1988.

[![ISEA2020](img/PN_Sentience_Site_700x400_EN-1.jpg)](https://www.facebook.com/events/montreal-quebec/isea-2020-montreal-international-symposium-of-electronic-arts/403662187174935/)

**ISEA 2020**: ["Printemps Numerique" (Computational Spring)](https://www.printempsnumerique.ca/en/) co-organize the event in 2020; [here is their blog post](https://www.printempsnumerique.ca/en/news/article/with-isea2020-montreal-will-host-a-major-international-art-and-technology-event/). It will form part of the [MTL Connect](http://mtlconnecte.ca/en/) series of events in Monreal May 19-24.

> MTL connect 2nd edition will feature five pavilions including ISEA2020 as the Creativity Pavilion, among FinTech Pavilion, AI, IoT & 4.0 Pavilion, City of the Future Pavilion, and Cybersecurity & Digital Identity Pavilion. This international event aims to explore the main question guiding the future of digital transformation, focusing on its cultural, economic, social and environmental impact on society.

The theme for ISEA2020 is **"SENTIENCE"**:

> Today, when more and more "emotionless" decisions are determined by algorithms and data, what is the value of human instinct and emotion? This is the guiding theme of the symposium, SENTIENCE: The ability to feel and perceive.

Montreal was awarded the hosting of the next ISEA at ISEA2019 held in Gwangju, South Korea in June 2019. The handover of the symbol of this year theme ‘Lux Aeterna’ took place during the closing ceremony, where Ms Soh Yeong Roh, Director of Art Centre Nabi in Seoul, hand over the eternal light to next year host Mr. Mehdi Benboubakeur, Executive Director of Montreal Digital Spring.

**Call for submissions**: The call for ISEA2020 is not yet posted; however you can get a sense of what the symposium involves and what the submission criteria and processes are like from [the 2019 Gwangju ISEA](http://isea2019.isea-international.org) or from [other prior ISEA symposia](http://www.isea-web.org/symposia/past-isea-symposia/). The deadline for submissions is not yet declared, but is likely to be late December/early January, which means you may be able to submit your work from this course. 

**Proceedings**: [Archives of the research proceedings of ISEA can all be found here.](http://www.isea-archives.org/proceedings-catalogue/)
